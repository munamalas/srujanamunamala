<!--About Section of Case Study-->
<h3 class="subheading">ABOUT</h3>
<p class="about">The goal is to create a responsive web design for a government organization of our choice. We decided to redesign the website for the Employment Development Department (EDD).  The EDD focuses on making sure that citizens in California get their employment benefits should anything occur.
 I was focusing on making sure that the users can optimially search for their new dream job.</p>
<!--Original Screenshots-->
<h3 class="subheading">ORIGINAL SCREENSHOTS</h3>
<img src="Jobs.png" class="screenshot">
<p class="jobs">This is the screen that is displayed when you enter the jobs section.  There is a lot of information that is thrown at the user.  This makes it very confusing for the user.  In addition, some of the links are duplicates and unnecessary.</p>
<img src="HomeScreen.png" class="screenshot">
<p class="homescreen">This is the Home Screen of the Employment Development Department website. One of the pain points was that there is repetition in regards to the icon and its description.  This is visible on the header.  There is no need for repetition.</p>
<!--Research for EDD-->
<h3 class="subheading">RESEARCH</h3>
<p class="research">When our team took a look at the website, we knew it was confusing but we wanted to see other users try it out.  I asked two people to try out the website to see what they thought about the state of the website.
When I asked the users to test the original website, I asked them to see if they were able to get to the CalJobs page (this is the page that allows the user to search for their next dream job).
<br> The users were eventually able to get to the final screen.  Here is a video of a user test.</p>

<!--Final Screens-->
<h3 class="subheading">FINAL SCREENS</h3>
<h4 class="CJPD">Cal Job Portal-Desktop Version</h4>
<img src="CalJobPortal.png" class="jobpic">
<img src="CalJobPortal – 1.png" class="jobpic">
<img src="Empty State-Cal Jobs Portal.png" class="jobpic">
<p class="jobdescription">These are the final screens for the Cal Jobs Portal that I created. The user would have two options. Either he or she can enter the job that they want using the search bar at the top of the page. They could also click on the corresponding category of interest. This would lead to the available job listings as shown. For the search bar, I wrote the corresponding text entry requested above the box. As humans, we tend to have limited attention spans. Also, some individuals have short term memory loss. This makes it harder for the individual to remember what he or she was supposed to type.
    I created a toggle that filters the results between Job Openings and Top Companies. Job Openings show the jobs that are currently seeking future employees. Top Companies filters the results based on ratings. It will also show how many positions are available and allow the user to see what the job post is and decide whether they want to apply for the position or not.</p>
<!--Navigation Screens-->
<h3 class="navscreens">NAVIGATION SCREENS</h3>
<img src="HomeScreen-FileJobs – 2.png" class="nav">
<img src="HomeScreen-FileJobs – 3.png" class="nav">
<img src="HomeScreen-FileJobs – 4.png" class="nav">
<p class="navdescription">This is the new home screen and navigation menu that I designed for the website.  
    If you remember the original layout, you'd remember that the whole page was covered with information.  This made it very confusing for the user to get from point A to B without any issues.  So, I took only the essential links from each section and made the menu accordingly.  The secondary information went towards the bottom.
    I believed that the main goal of the website was to be as helpful.  This is why I created a contingency plan.  I displayed the top 3 links on the home screen.  This is only in case a user does not want to go directly to the page through the menu.</p>
<!--iOS screens-->
<h3 class="iosscreens">CAL JOBS PORTAL-iOS SCREENS</h3>
<img src="ios1.png" class="ios">
<img src="ios2.png" class="ios">
<img src="ios3.png" class="ios">
<p class="iosdescription">This is the Cal Jobs Portal designed for iOS.  This idea behind this is similar to the Desktop version.  The only difference is how everything was organized on the screen.</p>
<!--Style Guide-->
<h3 class="styleguide">STYLE GUIDE</h3>
<img src="StyleGuide.png" class="guide">
<p class="styleguidedescription">This is the style guide that we developed for this project.  The main colors we used were blue, yellow, and white.  We used blue to create a calm feeling  for the website.  We used shades of yellow and orange so that we could maintain the California theme throughout the website.  The white was a text color for the headings.

    The fonts we used were Raleway, Helvitica, and Arial.  Raleway is generally used as a heading which is why we decided to use that font.  This was mainly used for the main headings of the page (e.g. header,  and title of the page).  Helvetica Neuve is generally used as text font.  We chose this font because we believed that it was the font that was legible.  Legibility is an important factor to consider when re-designing a website of a government organization.  This font was used for sub-headings (e.g. main category cards).  Arial was another font we used for text. This was mainly used for paragraph text within the cards.</p>
