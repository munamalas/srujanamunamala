<!--About Section of the Case Study-->
<h1 class="hermitheroes">HERMIT HEROES</h1>
<p class="description">Hackathon Project.  Tool used: Figma</p>
<h3 class="subheading">ABOUT</h3>
<p class="about">This was the first Hackathon that I participated in after completing my certification.  The project focused on turning social distancing into a game.  The game is not supposed to involve Big Brother.  This means that this game does not intend to collect user information.  
 The objective of the game is to make sure that the main character, Grandma Peach, continues to have low risk for contracting COVID-19.  This is done by having the user write journal entries about their day.  The more entries a user writes, the more toilet paper a user can earn.  Toilet paper is the currency that is used in the game.  The user can then use the toilet paper to buy materials that will help Grandma Peach. </p>

<h4 class="subheading">LOADING SCREENS</h4>
<img src="Loading1.png" class="load">
<img src="Loading2.png" class="load">
<img src="Loading3.png" class="load">
<p class="loadingdescription">These are the loading screens of the game.  The third screen is essentially a story that sets the tone for the game.  I drew the inspiration of including a story screen from an old computer game known as Prince of Persia.</p>
<!--OnBoarding Screens-->
<h4 class="subheading">ON-BOARDING</h4>
<img src="Onboarding1.png" class="onboard">
<img src="Onboarding2.png" class="onboard">
<img src="Onboarding3.png" class="onboard">
<img src="Onboarding4.png" class="onboard">
<img src="Onboarding5.png" class="onboard">
<p class="onboarddescription">These are the on-boarding screens that I designed for the game.  I made it so that every screen is a step.  In case the user did not want to provide their personal information, I offered users an alternative option. The user can login to the game using either Google or Facebook.</p>
<!--Main Screens-->
<h4 class="subheading">MAIN SCREENS</h4>
<img src="MainScreen1.png" class="main">
<img src="MainScreen2.png" class="main">
<img src="MainScreen3.png" class="main">
<p class="maindescription">These are the main screens.  The first two screens show the profile of the main character (Grandma Peach).  The objective of the game is to keep Grandma Peach's risk for contracting COVID-19 low hence the green bar.  If the risk becomes high, the bar would become red.  The toilet paper is the currency associated with this game.  In order to earn more toilet paper, the user needs to write more journal entries.  Each journal entry asks the following questions: Did you go outside? , If you did go outside why?, and What did you do today?

    I had originally combined the journal entries and the risk into one screen.  However I realized that it would not be effective for the user.  This is because it would be a clump of information that the user would have to sort through.  So I ended up splitting the information to two screens.  
    
    The journal entries are labeled as the number of days a user is stuck in quarantine.  The user can view the most recent entry written.  If the user wants to see more journal entries, they would have to click the "View More" button.  This shows the history of the journal entries.   </p>
<!--Profile Screens-->
<h4 class="subheading">PROFILE SCREEN</h4>
<img src="profile.png" class="profile">
<p class="profiledescription">This is the user profile screen.  The user has the option to add friends so that they can connect through the game.  The user also has the option to showcase their status updates on Facebook.  </p>
<!--Style Guide-->
<h4 class="subheading">STYLE</h4>
<img src="HermitHeroesStyleGuide.png" class="styleguide">
<p class="styleguidedescription">This was the style guide that we used to design the game Hermit Heroes.  We decided to go with shades of purple, yellow, orange, and blue to maintain a positive and cheerful mood while people are playing the game.
    The fonts we used for this application were Rubik and Montserrat.  We decided to go with Rubik because it looked uniform and symmetrical.  We used Rubik font for the heading.  We decided to use Montserrat for the body text.  We decided to use it because it was the font that matched with the heading font we used.</p>
