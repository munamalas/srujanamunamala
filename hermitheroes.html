<!--About Section of the Case Study-->
<h1 class="hermitheroes">HERMIT HEROES</h1>
<p class="description">Hackathon Project  <br>Tool used: Figma<br> Role: Design Lead</p>
<h3 class="subheading">ABOUT</h3>
<p class="abouthh"> We only had about a week to create a prototype for this hackathon so I did not get a chance to much user research.  
<br>The project focused on turning social distancing into a game.  The objective of the game is to make sure that the main character, Grandma Peach, continues to have low risk for contracting COVID-19.  This is done by having the user write journal entries about their activities.  The more entries a user writes, the more toilet paper they earn.  
We decided to use toilet paper as the currency because of what was going on in the news.  A lot of people across the nation were buying unnecessary amounts of toilet paper so it became a sacred commodity.  The user can use the toilet paper at the marketplace to purchase materials for Grandma Peach.
Our team wanted to emphasize privacy in the design.  This meant that the game would not collect any personal information from the user.</p>
<h3 class="subheading">ROLE</h3>
<p class="myrole">I was the design lead for this project.  I coordinated the visual aspects of the application.  Our team had a graphic designer who designed the logo, characters, and navigation icons. I placed the images onto the screen accordingly.  We submitted this project as a Proof of Concept.</p>

<h4 class="subheading">LOADING SCREENS</h4>
<img src="Loading1.png" class="load">
<img src="Loading2.png" class="load">
<img src="Loading3.png" class="load">
<p class="loadingdescription">
    These are the loading screens that I designed for the game.  
    It consists of a splash screen and a story that sets the tone and the scene for the game.  I got the idea of creating 
    a story screen from an old desktop game called Prince of Persia.

<!--OnBoarding Screens-->
<h4 class="subheading">ON-BOARDING</h4>

<p class="onboarddescription">
    These are the onboarding screens that I designed for the game.
    Each screen is designed to be a step that will help the user create a profile.
    My team wanted the profile screens to be consolidated, but I told them that will
    overwhelm the user.  I offered the user an alternate option.  If they did not want
    to provide their personal information, they could sign in using either Google or Facebook.
<!--Main Screens-->
<h4 class="subheading">MAIN SCREENS</h4>
<img src="MainScreen1.png" class="main">
<img src="MainScreen2.png" class="main">
<img src="MainScreen3.png" class="main">
<p class="maindescription">These are the main screens.  These screens focused on the overall helath of Grandma Peach and the Journal entries.  
 As I mentioned before, the objective is to make sure that Grandma Peach has a low risk of contracting COVID-19.  If the risk is low, the bar will be green. If the risk becomes high, the bar would become red. In order to earn more toilet paper, the user needs to write more journal entries.  
Each journal entry asks the following questions: </p>
<li class="list">Did you go outside?</li> 
<li class="list">If you did go outside why?</li>  
<li class="list">What did you do today?</li>
<p class="maindescription"> 
    The journal entries are labeled as the number of days a user is stuck in quarantine.  The user can view the most recent entry written.  If the user wants to see more journal entries, they would have to click the "View More" button.  This shows the history of the journal entries.
    <br>I originally combined the journal entries and the risk into one screen.  However I realized that it would overwhelm the user so I ended up splitting the information into two screens.  
</p>
<!--Profile Screens-->
<h4 class="subheading">PROFILE SCREEN</h4>
<img src="profile.png" class="profile">
<p class="profiledescription">This is the user profile screen.  The user has the option to add friends so that they can connect through the game.  
    The user also has the option to showcase their status updates on Facebook.</p>
<!--Style Guide-->
<h4 class="subheading">STYLE</h4>
<img src="HermitHeroesStyleGuide.png" class="styleguide">
<p class="styleguidedescription">This was the style guide that we used to design the game Hermit Heroes.  We decided to go with shades of purple, yellow, orange, and blue to maintain a positive and cheerful mood while people are playing the game.
    The fonts we used for this application were Rubik and Montserrat.  We decided to go with Rubik for the headings because it looked uniform and symmetrical.  According to Google Fonts, Rubik goes well with Montserrat. This was why we decided on 
    using Montserrat for the body text.</p>
<!--For the Future-->
<h4 class="subheading">FOR THE FUTURE</h4>
<p class="future">Our team believed that this application has a lot of potential.
I would like to redesign this application.  It looks good for a project that lasted a week, but I believe that the game
can be organized better.</p>
