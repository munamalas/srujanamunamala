<h3 class="problemstatementtitle">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
<p class="problem"> <b>How do we design a research database that is functional and that can provide
    a positive user experience?
</b></p>
<!--Process-->
<h3 class="process">PROCESS</h3>
<p class="processt">
    My process for this project had a major emphasis on research and design.  I have used research databases in the past for 
    labs, but I needed to get a deeper understanding of how to create a positive user experience. 
</p>
<!--Research Process-->
<h3 class="researchprocess">RESEARCH PROCESS</h3>
<p class="research">Before I could sketch the wireframes and design the final Desktop screens,
    I needed to understand how research databases worked and their painpoints.  So I conducted a heuristic analysis
    on some databases.  Some of these included Jstor, Wolfram Alpha, Science Open, Core, and Base.  While there were many positives, I was able to find 
    two main pain points:
    <ol style="text-align: center; list-style-position: inside;">
        <li class="list"><b> Misguided links</b> <br>One of the research article databases had some links that did not lead to the proper page.
            This provides a poor user experience for the user.
        </li>
        <li class="list"><b> Too much color</b> <br>While color is great because it provides a visual aesthetic appeal, it can also be a distraction.
        </li>
        </ol>
</p>
<!--Design Process-->
<h3 class="designprocess">DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
<p class="design"> Once I was satistifed with the research, I started to sketch out wireframes so I could figure out how to organize the content. 
    When I was brought on to the project, the stakeholder said that he wanted to pull the articles from two sources: medRxiv and the News.
    The stakeholder also wanted to add tags onto each of the results so that users will be able to search for those articles again.
    Once I got a solid understanding of what he was looking for, I went ahead and created the wireframes.
<!--Final Prototype-->
<h3 class="final">FINAL PROTOTYPE</h3>
<p class="finaldescription">Once I finalized how to organize the screens, I worked on creating a style guide.</p>
<img src="DinoSARSstyleguide.jpg" class="styleguide">
<p class="finaldescription">I converted all of the sketches into final designs using Figma.</p>
<img src="SearchResultDinoSARS.png" class=finalprototype>
<p class="key">
    This was a project that taught me about communicating with developers. When I started working on freelance projects, I always believed that designers knew everything.  However, thatâ€™s not the case.  We can dream of so many aesthetics to add, but we also need to think practically.  The goal of design is not just to visually attract users to the website.  It is to make sure that the user has a positive experience with the service so that they are more likely to return.
