<p class="aboutme">Hello! Hola! Guten Tag! Swagatham! My name is Srujana Munamala. I graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor's degree in Psychological Sciences in 2019. I additionally completed a certification course in UX/UI Design at UC Berkeley.  
    I was on the PreMed track during my freshman year at Purdue. During my sophomore year, I realized that this major was not for me. I decided to switch to Psychological Sciences. I did not know what to expect from this major.  I did not know anyone who majored in Psychology. A professor of mine recommended that I talk to Dr. Rollock, the head of the psychology department. He encouraged me to explore more about Psychology.  I was a Research Assistant in multiple labs. During the summer of 2018,  I was a Research Assistant for the Industrial Engineering Lab. I was helping out on a project regarding teenage driving. As I was working on the project, I started to develop an interest in UX/UI Design.
    If I am not working on any projects, you would most likely find me watching TV, listening to music, or talking to friends.  Some of my favorite shows include Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Chuck, White Collar, and How to Get Away With Murder. I also like hiking. During the Christmas holidays in 2019, my family and I hiked to Machu Picchu. </p>
