<h3 class="overviewtitle">OVERVIEW</h3>
<p class="overviewt">Calm On! is a game dedicated to teaching children ages 6-11 how to understand their emotions.  This project evolved from a hackathon concept.  We submitted this project to the UCSF COVID-19 Hackathon and won second place.  Our team is working towards releasing this game to the public.</p>

<!--Problem Statemnt Section-->
<div class="problemstatement">
<h3 class="problemstatementtitle">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
<p class="statement">Mental health is a prominent issue in todayâ€™s society.  However, most of the applications dedicated 
to this topic are predominantly targeted towards older individuals (e.g. high school and above).</p>
<p class="problem"> <b>How might we educate children ages 6-11 on a complex topic?</b></p>
</div>
<!--Process-->
<div class="generalprocess">
<h3 class="process">PROCESS</h3>
<p class="processt">Our process for this project emphasized on design, research, and user testing.  
    Since the target audience was children ages 6-11, we had to make sure our game was engaging and coherent. 
</p>
</div>
<!--Research Process-->
<div class="researchp">
<h3 class="researchprocess">RESEARCH PROCESS</h3>
<p class="research">We had a research team who read through multiple scholar articles regarding the following topics: children+video games,
children+mental health, video games+mental health, and other combinations.  The research team created questions which were then added onto a
Google survey that was sent out to parents (specifically those with children within our target age range) and teachers who taught younger children.
We got a total of 15 responses.  This survey allowed us to get a better understanding of what children missed the most because of this 
quarantine.

<!--Design Process-->
<div class="designp">
<h3 class="designprocess">DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
<p class="design">We conducted a competitor analysis on applications related to mental health.  These apps were MindShift, Wysa, Replika, Booster Buddy, WhatsUp, and Headspace.
  The happy face indicates what features were already there, and the frowny face indicates what was the pain point for each of the applications we analyzed.
<img src="competitiveanalysiscalmon.png" class="analysis">
<br>After completing that, we did a dot ideation which allowed us to determine the features that our team liked.  The top 4 features were:
<ol style="text-align: center; list-style-position: inside;">
<li class="list">A screen where users could rate their feelings for the day.</li>
<li class="list">Valuable info about anger or anxiety that the user could read.</li>
<li class="list">Thought Journal where the user can write anything about their day.</li>
<li class="list">Information about Healthy Habits that they can share with others.</li>
</ol>
<br> <p class="design">After looking through the points, we thought it would be a good idea to split the activities into 3 categories (mind, body, and spirit).
We created three coaches that would help guide the user through these activities.  They are:
<br>

<img src="Flynn.gif" class="character">
<img src="Aurora.gif" class="character">
<figcaption class="design">Left to Right: Sprite (spirit coach), Flynn (body coach), Aurora (mind coach)</figcaption>
<br> <p class="design">Each of these coaches have 2 activities that the user can choose from.  If the user chose Sprite (spirit coach), they could choose to have Sprite tell a story or teach users about 
the different ways to cope with emotions.  If the user chose Flynn (body coach), the user could watch some exercise videos or learn about healthy habits.  The healthy habits focused on 
teaching children the importance of hygine during these times.  If the user chose Aurora (mind coach), the user could choose to do a coloring activity or write in their 
journal.

<figcaption class="design">Left to Right: Sprite (spirit coach) activity, Flynn (body coach) activity, and Aurora (mind coach) activity. </figcaption>
<br> <p class="design">After gathering this information, the design team got together to conduct a design studio.  We went through a couple of revisions so that we could get a better sense of how we wanted to 
optimally design these screens.</p>

<!--Final Prototype-->
<div class="finals">
<h3 class="final">FINAL PROTOTYPE</h3>
<p class="finaldescription">Once we finalized how to organize the screens, we worked on creating a style guide.</p>
<img src="CalmOnStyleGuide.png" class="styleguide">
<p class="finaldescription">We converted all of the sketches into final designs using Figma.</p>
<p class="finaldescription">We shared our designs with some potential users to get some feedback.  Some of the comments we received were:
    <ol style="text-align: center; list-style-position: inside;">
    <li class="list">Journal entry categories were confusing.</li>
    <li class="list">Plus sign on keyboard was confusing.</li>
