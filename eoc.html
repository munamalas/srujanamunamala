<!--About Section of the Case Study-->
<h1 class="eoc">EAST OAKLAND COLLECTIVE</h1>
<p class="description">Case Study-UC Berkeley <br>          
Tool used: Sketch
<br> Role: UX Researcher </p>
<h3 class="subheading">ABOUT</h3>
<p class="about"> The objective was to provide a responsive web design solution for a non-profit organization named East Oakland Collective.
    This organization strives to help individuals that are currently seeking housing and food as well as volunteers that are willing to dedicate their time.  East Oakland Collective offers two activities that volunteers can participate in called Weekly Hot Meal Prep and Feed the Hood.  
    <b>The Weekly Hot Meal Prep program</b> is a bi-monthly event which provides community members with large scale opportunities to donate money, items and time to provide food and necessities to unhoused populations across Oakland. 
    <b>Feed the Hood</b> event volunteers are redirected to a Google form to register for the event.  <br>Weekly Hot Meal Prep has embarked on distributing 400 lbs of excess gourmet food from Silicon Valley and the South Bay to those in need in Oakland each week. Volunteers are asked to meet at a specific address and time, with the items they want to donate.
</p>
<!--User Research-->
<h3 class="subheading">RESEARCH</h3>
<p class="research">We wanted our research to answer the following questions:
    <li class="list">Why are people willing to volunteer at this organization?</li>
    <li class="list">Why do people choose to volunteer at these types of organizations?</li>
    <li class="list">What are the main pain points in determining where to find the appropriate forms?</li>
    <li class="list">Did anyone struggle with donating to the organization?  If so, what was the problem?</li>
</p>
<p class="research">We created a Google survey and sent it through 2 Facebook accounts.
    Out of the 21 people that completed the survey, 71.4% cared about homeless individuals.  60% of the people that donated to the 
    organization were highly likely to volunteer there as well. 
</p>
<p class="research">We conducted a competitor analysis on local shelters similar to East Oakland Collective.
    We focused our research on how they optimized their donation flows.  We researched three organizations: Lava Mae, Midnight Mission, and Street Sheet.

<!--User Personas-->
<h3 class="subheading">USER PERSONA</h3>
<p class="personadescription">We analyzed the results from our survey and created two personas: Mary and John.</p>
<img src="userpersona1.png" class="userpersona">

</p>
<img src="userpersona2.png" class="userpersona">

</p>
<!--Original Screenshot-->
<h3 class="subheading">ORIGINAL SCREENSHOTS</h3>
<p class="screenshotdescription">Before we could design the new screens, we conducted a heuristic analysis on the current website.
    We made notes about what we liked and did not like about the current website.
</p>
<img src="Volunteer.png" class="volunteer">
<p class="volunteerdescription">This is the Feed The Hood page.  Feed the Hood focuses on feeding the unhoused individuals within Berkeley, California.  The main problem with the page is that the cover image is not scaled properly.  As I mentioned in the previous photo, this page also has an organization issue.  </p>
<img src="Volunteer with East Oakland Collective - The East Oakland Collective.png" class="volunteer">
<p class="volunteerdescription">This is original screenshot of the volunteer page on the website.  The problem with the entire website is the organization.  When you click on the Feed the Hood tab box, it opens to another tab.  The Weekly Hot Meal Prep box opens to the bottom part of the page.</p>

<!--Style Guide-->
<h3 class="styleguide">STYLE GUIDE</h3>
<img src="StyleGuideEOC.png" class="styleguide">
<p class="styleguidedescription">This was the style guide we used for the application.  At first we wanted to use the turquoise shade throughout the entire application, but we realized that would not be ideal.  So we wanted to incorporate different colors into the application.
 We chose Raleway, Open Sans, and Flood Standard Impact Stats as the fonts for the application because we believed that these fonts complemented each other.</p>
