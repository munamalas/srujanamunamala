    <h3 class="problemstatementtitle">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
    <p class="statement">The East Oakland Collective is a non-profit organization dedicated to assisting 
        individuals with their basic needs.  When our team initially browsed through the website, we noticed 
        that their website could be improved.
    </p>
    <p class="problem"> <b>How might we create a cohesive and simple design for a non-profit organization?
    </b></p>
</div>
<!--Process Section-->
<!--Process-->
<div class="generalprocess">
<h3 class="process">PROCESS</h3>
<p class="processt">
    Our process for this project involved research and design.  We needed to understand the pain points of the original site
    so we could create a cohesive and simple design.
</p>
</div>
<!--Research Process-->
<div class="researchp">
<h3 class="researchprocess">RESEARCH PROCESS</h3>
<p class="research">We contacted the CEO of the organization, Candice Elder, and asked her questions about 
    how East Oakland Collective managed the following flows: donation, volunteering, and community service.
    <br>
<p class="research">After that, we created a google survey that asked questions about the following topics:
    <ol style="text-align: center; list-style-position: inside;">
        <li class="list">Why are people volunteering at this organization?</li>
        <li class="list">Why do people like to join these organizations?</li>
        <li class="list">Have users ran into any issues while completing a task?</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p class="research">We sent this survey through 2 Facebook accounts and got a total of 21 responses.
We synthesized the results and created 2 personas.  Meet Mary and John!</p>
</p>

<!--Design Process-->
<div class="designp">
<h3 class="designprocess">DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
<p class="design">Before our team could start designing the final prototype, we conducted a competitor analysis on
    other local non-profit organizations.  The goal was to understand how other organizations organized their flows.
</p>
<img src="competitoranalysis.png" class="analysis">
<br>
<p class="design">
    We started sketching how the flows would look like.

<!--Final Prototype-->
<div class="finals">
<h3 class="final">FINAL PROTOTYPE</h3>
<p class="finaldescription">Once we finalized how to organize the screens, we worked on creating a style guide.
    We took these sketches and converted them into a final prototype.
</p>
<img src="StyleGuideEOC.png" class="styleguide">
<!--Final Key Points-->
<p class="key">
    Like any project, this one had its ups and downs.  We managed to get in touch with the stakeholder.  
    The answers we recieved helped us identify the key problems.  This was a short project, but we managed
    to learn a new tool (Sketch). We were able to communicate with each other effectively.  
    Hopefully next time, we can add more micro interactions to the forms to make it more engaging.  Hopefully, we can 
    improve upon this design in the future.
