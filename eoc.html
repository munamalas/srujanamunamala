<!--About Section of the Case Study-->
<h1 class="eoc">EAST OAKLAND COLLECTIVE</h1>
<p class="description">Case Study-UC Berkeley           
Tool used: Sketch </p>
<h3 class="subheading">ABOUT</h3>
<p class="about">This project was done as part of the agenda for the UX/UI Design Certification.  The objective was to re-design the website of a non-profit organization of our choice.  We decided to go for the East Oakland Collective.
    The East Oakland Collective is a non-profit organization in Berkeley, California. This organization strives to help those that are currently seeking housing and food.  East Oakland Collective offers two activities that volunteers can participate in.  These events are called Weekly Hot Meal Prep and Feed the Hood.  Hot Meal Prep allows volunteers to distribute food to the homeless. Feed the Hood is where volunteers would prepare and distribute food to the homeless individuals.
    I did this project with 2 other talented designers.  We focused on three main flows: Donation of Food, Donating money, and Volunteering.  I was the UX Designer for the Volunteer Flow.  I also worked on the final presentation.  The other two members made the Desktop version while I did the iOS version.</p>

<h3 class="subheading">ORIGINAL SCREENSHOTS</h3>

<p class="volunteerdescription">This is the Feed The Hood page.  Feed the Hood focuses on feeding the unhoused individuals within Berkeley, California.  The main problem with the page is that the cover image is not scaled properly.  As I mentioned in the previous photo, this page also has an organization issue.  </p>

<p class="volunteerdescription">This is original screenshot of the volunteer page on the website.  The problem with the entire website is the organization.  When you click on the Feed the Hood tab box, it opens to another tab.  The Weekly Hot Meal Prep box opens to the bottom part of the page.</p>
<!--Final Design iOS Version-->

<p class="feedhooddescription">These are some of the screens that I helped design the Feed the Hood flow for the iOS version.  The idea is to help make sure that the user can get through the flow without any issues.  I created a progress bar so that the user can tell at which point they are at.  Each of the items have a checkbox next to it so that the user can select more than one item.  If I went with radioactive button, that would cause a problem for users that wish to donate more than one item. </p>
<!--Style Guide-->
<h3 class="styleguide">STYLE GUIDE</h3>
<img src="StyleGuideEOC.png" class="styleguide">
<p class="styleguidedescription">This was the style guide we used for the application.  At first we wanted to use the turquoise shade throughout the entire application, but we realized that would not be ideal.  So we wanted to incorporate different colors into the application.
    We chose Raleway, Open Sans, and Flood Standard Impact Stats as the fonts for the application because we believed that these fonts complemented each other.</p>
